# Notes from Git., GitHub and GitKraken Course 2022-11-28

Here are the notes I've taken from the [course](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/).

I've learned how to.

1. Create a repository on GitHub and clone it locally.
2. How to _Stage_, _commit_, and _Push_ from my **local** repository to the **origin**.
3. How to _Pull_ from **origin** to **local**.


Next I'm going to publish a WebPage!
